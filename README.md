# Image_Manipulation
series of different filters for image manipulation

A sample picture is in the repository as "BrightnessandContrast.ppm" 

the images were manipulated by taking each indicidual pixel and changing its Red, Blue, or Green values. each color could hold up to 256 bits so a number of 0 would be black and a number of 256 for all colors would be white.
